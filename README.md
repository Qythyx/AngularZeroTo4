# AngularZeroTo4
This repository contains example files that follow my blog post describing getting Angular running starting at zero. See http://www.qythyx.com/blog/2017/4/22/angular-zero-to-2.

Each folder in this directory cooresponds to one blog post, which is one step along the journey. Note that I don't include the `node_modules` folder or the output `distrib` folder. To populate the first run `npm install`, and to populat the second run `npm build` or `npm install`.
